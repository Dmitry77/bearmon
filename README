bearmon
=======

bearmon is a simple server monitoring tool designed to require minimal configuration.

* Checks each define one monitoring instance, for example a URL to make sure is OK.
* A contact is a communication instance, for example an email address or a phone number (for SMS).
* Alerts connect checks with contacts, so that the contact will be alerted when the check goes offline.

Installation
------------

Create a database from the schema defined in `install.sql`.

Setup
-----

First, look at config.php and configure database, mail, and other settings.

Define a check. The one below will make sure the URL contains the given substring.

    INSERT INTO checks (name, type, data) VALUES ('example.com', 'http_contains', 'http://example.com/critical.php|hello world');

Define a contact.

    INSERT INTO contacts (type, data) VALUES ('email', 'admin@example.com');

Define an alert.

    INSERT INTO alerts (check_id, contact_id) VALUES (1, 1);

Now, run bearmon:

    php monitor.php
